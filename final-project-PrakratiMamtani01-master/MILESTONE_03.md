Special Instructions for Form 2
---
Once you login or register using a valid username you will be redirected to a home page. There you will see a form about how are you feeling today once you select your mood and click open, it will suggest you a song to listen to according to that mood. This has been done by first populating database using spotify API and then reading database to generate appropriate song. This form will generate a modal element but since i have not added close modal button yet please got to /home route again to find out the song for a different mood.
